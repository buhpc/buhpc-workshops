write a MMM function following the formula on the slides, then try adding openMP
2. Relaxation function 
Write a function that takes in a 2d array as an input, and for each cell (excluding corners and edges)calculates the average of that cell and all of their adjacent neighbors.
    e.g., array A = [1, 1,  1,  1,  1, 
                     2, 7,  8,  9,  10,
                     6,-1, 0, -5 -10]
          output = [1,  1,  1,  1,  1,
                    2,  3.4,5,  23, 1,
                    6,  -1, 0,  -5, -10]
    Then, try parallelizing it with OpenMP.

    Lastly, modify your code to run this "relaxation" function 100 times, then look at the output.
